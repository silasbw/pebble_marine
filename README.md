# Pebble Marine

Pebble marine displays speed (knots), bearing (degrees), current speed
(knots), current bearing (degrees), and tides (minutes to change).

Pebble marine uses the [CO OPS API](http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/api/) to get
current speed, current bearing, and tide predictions from the closest stations
less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away.
